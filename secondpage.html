			<h1>Jensen's Plea</h1>
			<!--Paragraph-->
			<p>Jensen's life began in an alley in the rough and tumble backstreets of Thunder Bay. His childhood was difficult to say the least. He lived with and regularly fought other feral kittens until the day he was 
			scooped up and broughtto Caring Hearts Cat Rescue. Though his independence had been taken from him, his new situation saw him being fed and pampered. It wasn't long until an unwitting man name Daniel Gareau found
			him there and took him home. Jensen vowed on that day to protest his loss of independence everyday with mischeivous acts such as eating every shoe lace in the house and 3am sprints ending with dive bombs into his 
			sleeping owner's chest.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, even proud tomcats need family. Furry family. Jensen longs for brothers he can scamper and eat houseplants with. This website is his hope for a future furry family."
